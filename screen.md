Yes

## 2
No

## 3
Yes. I have been programming C, low-level C++, and modern C++ for
approximately four years. I've written around 10,000 to 15,000 lines of code in
these languages. I would call this 'proficient'.

## 4
I have experience with both. I use and develop for both regularly, and
maintain both OSes on my laptop.

## 5
I have also been programming in Python for around four years, with an
estimated 5,000 lines of code written. My Python experience includes
- Several game AI algorithms, including pathfinding and autogeneration of world
geometry
- Many data scraping scripts, collecting hundreds of thousands of datapoints
- A Pokemon team prediction neural network using ScikitLearn
- A full emulation of Pokemon Red
- Machine learning and optimization algorithms such as:
- A gradient descent + stochastic gradient descent solver;
- An implementation of Newton's Method for finding roots
- A delayed repetition flashcard app for learning Chinese vocabulary

I have not written a single Python program >1000 lines, so I would classify this

as 'intermediate-proficient'

My current project is my 2D game engine, tdengine. It is at around 5000 lines
of C++ and Lua code right now. Virtually everything is written from scratch, and
I have written all of it. Features include:
- In-game level editor
- Interoperability between C++ and Lua; all scripting of game objects is done in
Lua
- Dynamic reloading of Lua code without re-compiling the engine
- Tree-based dialogue system to construct arbitrarily complex sequences of
dialogue
- Renderer written in OpenGL
- Custom pool allocators
- Font rendering
- Dynamic texture atlas generation
- Automated asset pipeline for getting assets such as textures etc. into the game
