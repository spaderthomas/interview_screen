Coding samples can be found on the same GitHub user as these forms were pushed
to. The ones of note are: 
- Don't Blink, a 3D game engine written in C++
- tdengine, a 2D game engine written in C++ (expanded more in screen.md)
- bullbot, a Pokemon RBY simulator and machine learning agent written in C++ and
  Python 
  
I can expand on any if necessary in a follow up.
